# Runtime contexts

`tooling/qa/guards/architecture/runtime-topology/runtime-topology.data.json` owns runtime roots, manifest ownership, entrypoints, and documentation markers. This document owns runtime coordination rules.

## Coordination

Apply the runtime dependency rule in [code organization](code-organization.md#dependency-direction) and the residency rules in [shared topology](shared-topology.md). Put runtime-specific coordination rules in this document.

Parse cross-runtime messages at the receiver. Treat sender identity as context proof, not operation authority. Require a trusted local gesture or owner-scoped short-lived capability for privileged actions initiated by page DOM events. Validate capability or lease scope, owner, operation, identity, generation, purpose, freshness, expiry, and replay state before side effects.

## Background

`apps/extension/src/background/index.ts` is the service-worker entrypoint. The background runtime owns privileged APIs, lifecycle, route authorization and dispatch, capture and recording orchestration, and background-local state.

`apps/extension/src/contracts/messaging/contracts/runtime/background-ingress.data.ts` owns background-ingress descriptors. Keep runtime handler and authorization bindings exhaustive over its IDs. Keep dispatch policy in the action kernel and domain behavior in named route or lifecycle owners. Keep legacy family routers as adapters.

## Content

`apps/extension/src/content/index.tsx` is the content entrypoint. Content owns page DOM access, Shadow DOM UI, capture preparation, parsing, export preparation, and apply-back. Treat host DOM as untrusted. Restore page state changed for capture.

`apps/extension/src/features/drawing` owns renderer-neutral drawing documents, geometry, and transforms. `apps/extension/src/content/drawing` owns DOM and Canvas rendering, input, session lifecycle, and reversible page-preparation effects. Persist palette and tool preferences only. Keep the active tool and drawing document disposable.

## Extension and editing pages

`apps/extension/src/popup/index.tsx`, `apps/extension/src/settings/index.tsx`, `apps/extension/src/gallery/index.tsx`, `apps/extension/src/design-system/index.tsx`, `apps/extension/src/web-snapshot-viewer/index.tsx`, `apps/extension/src/camera-recorder/index.tsx`, `apps/extension/src/editor/index.tsx`, `apps/extension/src/video-editor/index.tsx`, and `apps/extension/src/scenario-editor/index.tsx` own their page shells and page-local workflows. Durable state remains in named persistence owners. Apply the [video-editor layering rules](video-editor-layering.md) inside the video-editor runtime.

## Offscreen

`apps/extension/src/offscreen/offscreen.ts` owns delegated media capture, recording, viewport, export, clipboard image delivery, and voice-input work. `apps/extension/src/background/offscreen-document` owns document lifecycle.

Accept offscreen commands only from the verified background channel. Validate freshness, command binding, and rate limits before updating idempotency state. Key side-effect deduplication by binding generation and request, job, or recording identity. [Platform tradeoffs](platform-patterns-and-tradeoffs.md#security-tradeoffs) owns the legacy field-name semantics.

Keep reusable voice input under `workflows/voice-input`, `background/voice-input`, and `offscreen/voice-input`. Register each consumer policy explicitly. Scope events to the active consumer Port. Translate the private offscreen session nonce to consumer identity in background. Serialize video recording, desktop capture, and speech recognition through one offscreen media-activity lease.

## Effect sandbox

`apps/extension/src/effect-runtime-sandbox/index.html` is the manifest sandbox for EffectV1 frame evaluation. It has no extension API authority. [EffectV1 bundles](video-effect-bundles.md#runtime) owns its runtime contract.

## State and egress

`apps/extension/src/background/capture/jobs/state-machine.ts` owns capture and download jobs. `apps/extension/src/composition/persistence/export-ledger/index.ts` owns project-export ledger state. Tie advisory runtime maps to these durable or revisioned owners.

Use `apps/extension/src/features/ai/privacy/index.ts` and the content egress pipeline for sanitized AI payloads. Apply [data handling](../security/data-handling.md) to secrets, retention, diagnostics, and headers.

## Runtime changes

For a new or changed runtime, update the runtime registry, manifest or build input, entrypoint ownership, documentation marker, and drift proof. Declare a privileged background route once beside its parser with handler, authorization, sender, freshness and replay, policy-state, failure-response, and owner metadata.
